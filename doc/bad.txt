does not find function anymore,
if it is in a seperate unit (FCmdArg).
do i need extern ?


->Uniting similar setter and getter functions.
As a workaround I have put in ObjectCareobjcare (template)
and even there recursion has not worked.<-
ObjectCare takes care of all objects ?

Variadic template width A
7-41-22
Tried something whith the args keyword




Bad Readability. For instance ugly calls in main.

Non intuitive counting from zero.

Is ist possible to replace/redo Class/Template Structure in ASM
for more ->flexibility<- regarding this particular modeling purpose ?

what would i do different in assembler ?

deeper inheritance instead of objcare
doin list


Why is bool an int and not a char ?


ListAndIteratorObjectCare
Why cant i have objcare as common base class
using polymorphism ?
Cause of the has (multible) relation.


layer has 3 iterators and no list (per element)
objcare has one list and one iterator (per element)
therefore layer does not fit into objcare
 
layers can be defined as a list of elements (nodes (,edges))
then it would fit into objcare

objcare backport
