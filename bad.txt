Frustration
===========

Running into unexpected trouble
while trying to implement a debug level
set by a command line argument trough *(argv[1]).

Instead of DeleteListAndTheirElements.h my self, I would like to use
ptrlist from the standard libary or boost again, but the compiler won't let me.

->Uniting similar setter and getter functions.
As a workaround I have put in objcare (template)
and even there recursion has not worked.<-

Bad Readability. For instance ugly calls in main.

Non intuitive counting from zero.

Is ist possible to replace/redo Class/Template Structure in ASM
for more ->flexibility<- regarding this particular modeling purpose ?
